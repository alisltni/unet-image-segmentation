# U-Net Image Segmentation (PyTorch)

This repository contains a notebook that implements a U-Net model for image segmentation using PyTorch. The project demonstrates a full pipeline for training a convolutional encoder–decoder network to produce pixel-wise segmentation masks.

The notebook includes data loading and preprocessing, model definition, training and validation loops, and qualitative visualization of predicted masks. The architecture follows the standard U-Net design with a contracting path for feature extraction and an expanding path for spatial reconstruction using skip connections.

The goal of this project is to show practical implementation and training of a segmentation network and to analyze its behavior on a labeled image dataset.
